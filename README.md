<h1>AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity virtual experience</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I worked on a project to create a cyber threat analysis simulation, delving into the possible vulnerabilities and how to fix them. I practiced using tools and languages relevant to cybersecurity such as Python, building my skills in a real-world context. 
This experience confirmed my passion for addressing cybersecurity challenges, and I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills on AIG's cybersecurity team to contribute to solving real-world problems.

* Completed a cybersecurity threat analysis simulation for the Cyber Defense Unit, staying updated on CISA publications. 
* Researched and understood reported vulnerabilities, showcasing analytical skills in cybersecurity. 
* Drafted a clear and concise email to guide teams on vulnerability remediation. 
* Utilized Python skills to write a script for ethical hacking, avoiding ransom payments by bruteforcing decryption keys.
